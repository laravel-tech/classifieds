## WARNING

Do not modify the `Vendor` containers. 

Every container in this `Vendor` folder, will be overwritten after a `composer update`.

To modify the code of any `Vendor` container, you should first copy the container to the `AppSection` (or any of your custom sections). _(And don't forget to update the namespace)._
